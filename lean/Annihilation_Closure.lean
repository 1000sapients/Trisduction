  Annihilation_Closure.lean · The Master Annihilation Closure.
  Core Lean 4.19.0, standalone: no import, no axiom declared, no sorry, no admit, no native_decide.

  BOOKS ONE AND TWO are `lean/Remembered_Offered.lean` carried byte-identical below, its own header included:
  the two denials, the price, the monism-fixed toy of the bound, and the harvest of 7 October 2026 with its
  capstones `the_chain` and `the_harvest`.

  BOOK THREE is the annihilation closure, harvested on 7 October 2026:
  I    four names, one proposition: least erasure, the value, Monism and the co-location of Being with Monism;
  II   Monism, the sole witness: every faithful witness is Monism, no reading of the record witnesses, and
       a witness is never universal;
  III  co-location is not universal: Being stands on the off-line pair configuration and Monism does not;
  IV   the timeless zone: one proposition, the locus resting both instruments, zero time remembering, every
       later time forgetting, closure at zero time exactly at Λ = 0, the upstream unforced;
  V    timeless is determinacy, not selection;
  VI   the check: the off-line pair configuration satisfies every principle of the closure and lacks the value,
       its twin has it;
       no principle true on every closed configuration decides the value;
  VII  the capstones: `the_timeless_zone_closed`, the timeless zone with no act anywhere in it, and
       `the_annihilation_closure`, the zone together with the act's conjunct of the time world.

  BOOK FOUR is the Unicorn, contained. `lean/RH_Unicorn_Block.lean` is carried byte-identical below, its own header
  included: the cut at a height, the formal block, the aperture one bit wide, existence supplying nothing, no bypass,
  the supply side silent, the certificate, and the three bits as one term. Book Four binds it to the chart:
  I    the cut on the chart, at every height;
  II   no bypass on the chart;
  III  the Unicorn blocked on the chart, above every height;
  IV   RA supplies nothing to the Unicorn part;
  V    on the act's zero set, every arrival above every height stands on the line;
  VI   the capstone, `the_unicorn_contained`;
  VII  every record on the line: the registration row carries no bit;
  VIII one bit, every row: least erasure, zero erased bits, zero price, the value and the Unicorn part are one
       proposition.

  Stated whole, locked 7 October 2026: the timeless zone is closed, LE = RH = Monism, one proposition, with zero
  gap, proved; RH is the statement that ζ's zero set lies in the timeless zone. Book Three proves the first and
  assumes nothing; its sixth section proves that nothing every closed configuration shares can single out ζ. In
  the time world the statement enters only where Book One's `ActualZeros` is taken as input. The cones are printed
  at the foot and pinned.

  Remembered_Offered.lean · The Remembered and the Offered: One Self, One Place at a Time.
  Core Lean 4.19.0, standalone: no import, no axiom declared, no sorry, no admit, no native_decide.

  BOOK ONE is carried unchanged: Two_Denials.lean whole (the deed and the self-grounding root from Armed_Seat.lean,
  the chart, the record, the act and the deed's law from Force_Witness.lean, the monism witness from Codex.lean,
  the two denials at the two layers of one root); the finite configuration and its price from Inescapable_Capstone.lean;
  the toy of the bound from Codex.lean, monism fixed, namespace RALi.

  BOOK TWO is the harvest of 7 October 2026, in binding order:
  I    the Tongue always has a world; monism, not the Tongue, tells the worlds apart;
  II   one self, one place at a time: the floor and least erasure are two objects;
  III  the twins: one extension, two instruments, neither the voucher of the other;
  IV   the remembered and the offered: memory is lossless, a world is its own memory exactly when the value holds;
  V    forgetting and remembering: one sequence, a one-bit gap, always connected;
  Vb   the forcing by heat: return is free, resistance pays, the free path is one;
  VI   THE CHAIN: the root, forgetting, the locus in the middle, remembering, least erasure;
  VIb  zero time remembers, every later time forgets;
  VII  two doors and no third, the act shuts the second;
  VIII a band forces nothing;
  IX   the harvest, bound.

  Stated whole: everything is proved except the offer at the actual zeros, which enters only as the field `supply`
  of `ActualZeros`, the act, at premise grade. The cones are printed at the foot and pinned.

/-- MONISM IS THE SOLE WITNESS. Every faithful witness of the value is the root read twice, as one proposition; no
reading of the record witnesses, since the true configuration and the off-line pair configuration leave one
record; the floor witnesses nothing, standing on both; and Monism stands on the true configuration and not on the
pair, on that one record. -/

/-- THE TIMELESS ZONE. Least erasure and the value are one proposition; at the locus the two instruments coincide;
at zero time the record tells the true configuration from the pair, at every later time it does not; the closure at zero
time is Λ = 0; and the passage back to zero time is not forced by the forward arrow. -/

/-- TIMELESS IS DETERMINACY, NOT SELECTION. At zero time the record's freedom is gone: it separates the true world
from the pair. Every configuration stands behind at most one door. And both doors stay open on closed
configurations: the off-line pair configuration is closed, lacks the value, and has the floor standing on it.
Removing the freedom fixes each configuration as what it is; it does not single out ζ. -/

/-! ## VI · The check -/

/-- THE CHECK. The off-line pair configuration satisfies every principle of the timeless closure and lacks the value: it is
closed; the floor stands on it; least erasure, the value and Monism are one proposition on it; corrected monism
holds, it carries no witness; it leaves the true world's record; at zero time the width-one world is determinately
not real, with Λ = 1. Its twin, the true world, satisfies the same principles and has the value. -/

Monism is the sole witness; no witness is universal; neither Monism nor co-location is universal; LE = RH; zero time

no witness is universal; co-location is not universal; the timeless zone holds; timelessness is determinacy and

RH_Unicorn_Block.lean · the Unicorn part of the Riemann Hypothesis, closed to derivation, its
aperture one bit wide, its supply side silent. Core Lean 4.19.0, no library, no sorry, no user-declared axiom. 2026-09-25.

Part III divided the hypothesis at a height T into a Real part and a Unicorn part and proved
the Real part by certificate. Parts I and II proved the wall, the crossing, the bound, and the
cure theorem, and did not say what they say of the Unicorn part. This file says it: closed to
derivation, the aperture one bit wide, the register silent beyond it. ΔM = 0.
